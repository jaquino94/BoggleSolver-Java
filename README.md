**NOTE:** 
Converted the C++ code from another repository into Java code and created the GUI using JavaFX.

**How it works:** 
It works the same way the C++ program does, but since in Java, there are only references, we assign each references to each indices that the values corrolate to. 
```Java
//charArr is an array of TreeNode objects. 
 this.charArr = new TreeNode[MAX_SIZE];
 ```
 We keep doing this for each character of the strings, just like in the C++ program.
